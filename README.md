1. Dependency free Java only Mavenized Android library
2. Support for any USB Host capable Android device
3. Support for USB webcam implementations that adhere to the UVC 1.5 classification
4. Support for full range of device resolutions (240p and greater)
5. Simple integration to 3rd party applications with multiple implementation options dependant on use case requirements.
